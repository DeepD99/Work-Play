# Work-Play
The objective of this program is to convert one word into another from a given dictionary text file, such as converting "Work" into "Play".
In this program I incorporate the use of vectors, void functions and conditional statements to 
1.) Find a word with a certain length
2.) See if a word is in the dictionary
3.) Enter 2 words and count the number of words that are in between them by only changing one letter
4.) Start with the word dog and get to the word cat by only changing one letter
5.) Do the samething as #4, but without having to input anything. The function runs until it finds the end word, by the end it creates a tree of all the similiar words
6.) Do #5, but only show that the finds the winning sequence is found
7.) Do #4, but in reverse. Unfortunately me and partner couldn't finish this part.
8.) Exit the program.
